## 🚧 **Immediate Next Actions**

### **Priority 1: Apply Code Analysis to All Competitors**

**Status**: OpenLit updated ✅, Traceloop/Arize/Langfuse need updates ⏳

**Tasks**:
1. ⏳ Update task-2-traceloop-analysis.md with deep code analysis steps
2. ⏳ Update task-3-arize-analysis.md with deep code analysis steps
3. ⏳ Update task-4-langfuse-analysis.md with deep code analysis steps

**Pattern**: Follow OpenLit task structure:
- Step 1: Clone repository
- Step 2: Code structure analysis
- Step 3: Feature inventory via code
- Step 4: Architecture via code
- Step 5: Performance via code
- Step 6: Trace sources via code
- Step 7: Data fidelity via code
- Step 8: Supplemental docs
- Step 9: Compile report

### **Priority 2: Build Phase 4 & 5**

**Status**: Not started ⏳

**Requirements**: Define purpose and tasks for:
- Phase 4: [To be determined based on analysis goals]
- Phase 5: [To be determined based on analysis goals]

### **Priority 3: Build Phase 0 Tasks**

**Status**: Orchestrator complete, tasks pending ⏳

**Requirements**: Define 4 setup tasks for research initialization

## 🎯 **User Preference: Accuracy Over Speed**

Per user directive: "Always want accuracy over speed, better to do work right the first time so we do not end up with many cycles of rework."

**Framework Design Aligned**:
- ✅ Deep code analysis (not just docs)
- ✅ Evidence-based claims
- ✅ Systematic task decomposition
- ✅ Agent OS standards compliance
- ✅ Command language usage
- ✅ File size constraints

---

## 🔄 **Next Decision Point**

**User Choice Required**:

**Option A**: Continue building remaining framework files
- Update Traceloop/Arize/Langfuse tasks with code analysis
- Build Phase 4 & 5 orchestrators and tasks
- Build Phase 0 tasks
- **Effort**: ~14 more files

**Option B**: Execute Phase 1 with current framework
- Begin internal HoneyHive assessment
- Identify any framework gaps during execution
- Refine framework based on real usage
- **Effort**: Start analysis now, refine as needed

**Option C**: Hybrid approach
- Finish Phase 2 competitor task updates (3 files)
- Execute Phase 1 & 2
- Build Phase 4 & 5 based on findings
- **Effort**: 3 files now, then execute

---

**Recommendation**: Option C - Finish Phase 2 competitor updates, then execute. This ensures code-first analysis is applied consistently across all competitors before beginning research.
