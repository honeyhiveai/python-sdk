- [ ] [Recommendation 2] - [Timeline]

### High Impact, High Effort (Major Projects)
- [ ] [Recommendation 1] - [Timeline]
- [ ] [Recommendation 2] - [Timeline]

### Low Impact, Low Effort (Fill-ins)
- [ ] [Recommendation 1] - [Timeline]

### Low Impact, High Effort (Avoid)
- [Recommendation 1] - [Reason to deprioritize]
```

### **Step 3: Define Implementation Phases**

⚠️ EVIDENCE-REQUIRED: Phased timeline

**Goal**: [Objective]
**Duration**: 12 weeks
**Team Size**: [NUMBER] engineers
**Budget**: [ESTIMATE]

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] [Deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2]
```

### **Step 4: Resource Requirements**

⚠️ EVIDENCE-REQUIRED: Resource planning

🛑 DOCUMENT: Resource needs
```markdown
### Engineering Resources

| Phase 1 | [NUM] | [Skills] | [WEEKS] |
| Phase 2 | [NUM] | [Skills] | [WEEKS] |
| Phase 3 | [NUM] | [Skills] | [WEEKS] |

### Infrastructure Resources
- [Resource 1]: [Cost] - [When needed]
- [Resource 2]: [Cost] - [When needed]

### External Resources
- [Resource 1]: [Cost] - [Purpose]
- [Resource 2]: [Cost] - [Purpose]
```

### **Step 5: Success Metrics**

⚠️ EVIDENCE-REQUIRED: Measurable outcomes

🛑 DOCUMENT: Success criteria
```markdown
### Phase 1 Success Metrics
- Metric 1: [Baseline] → [Target]
- Metric 2: [Baseline] → [Target]
- Metric 3: [Baseline] → [Target]

### Phase 2 Success Metrics
- Metric 1: [Baseline] → [Target]
- Metric 2: [Baseline] → [Target]

### Phase 3 Success Metrics
- Metric 1: [Baseline] → [Target]
- Metric 2: [Baseline] → [Target]

### Overall Success Metrics
- Feature parity: [Current %] → [Target %]
- OTel compliance: [Current %] → [Target %]
- Data fidelity: [Current %] → [Target %]
- Competitive rank: [Current] → [Target]
```

### **Step 6: Risk Mitigation**

⚠️ EVIDENCE-REQUIRED: Risk planning

🛑 DOCUMENT: Risk matrix
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] | [Role] |
| [Risk 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] | [Role] |
| [Risk 3] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Strategy] | [Role] |

### **Step 7: Dependencies and Blockers**

⚠️ EVIDENCE-REQUIRED: Dependency mapping

🛑 DOCUMENT: Critical path
```markdown
### Critical Dependencies
- Dependency 1: [What] - [On whom] - [Timeline]
- Dependency 2: [What] - [On whom] - [Timeline]

### Potential Blockers
- Blocker 1: [What] - [Mitigation]
- Blocker 2: [What] - [Mitigation]
```

### **Step 8: Create Roadmap Document**
